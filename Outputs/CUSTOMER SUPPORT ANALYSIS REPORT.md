### üßæ **Customer Support Analysis Summary Report**

####  üéØ **Objective:**

To categorize customer support tickets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, identify the most frequently reported problems, and recommend actionable process improvements to enhance customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.



### üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Insights


### 1. Ticket Distribution

* The most common issues are related to Performance, Account Access, and Software Updates.

* Tickets about Data Security and Follow-ups appear less frequently but are often more sensitive in nature.


### 2. Part of Speech (POS) Analysis

* **Dominant parts of speech**: Nouns and verbs, indicating action-based and issue-centered descriptions.

Frequent use of words like ‚Äúunable‚Äù, ‚Äúerror‚Äù, ‚Äúslow‚Äù, ‚Äúlogin‚Äù shows clear patterns in user frustration and needs.


### 3. N-gram Analysis

* Common bigrams and trigrams:

‚Äúlogin issue‚Äù, ‚Äúunable access‚Äù, ‚Äúslow response‚Äù, ‚Äúpassword reset‚Äù

Indicates the need for better onboarding support, faster resolution pipelines, and better system reliability.


### **Recommended Process Improvements**

### 1. Improve Login & Authentication Experience

* Simplify password reset process.

* Implement two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security and trust.

* Add clear error messages and troubleshooting steps for login failures.


### 2. Enhance Software Update Communication

* Proactively notify users about upcoming updates.

* Provide version compatibility info and rollback options if issues arise.


### 3. Optimize System Performance Monitoring

* Regularly monitor app performance and set automated alerts for latency spikes or crashes.

* Create a lightweight troubleshooting guide for common lag/crash issues.


### 4. Tighten Data Security Measures

* Educate users on secure account practices.

* Publish transparency reports on resolved security issues.

* Automate alerts for unusual user activity.


### 5. Strengthen Customer Follow-up Systems

* Implement SLA tracking for ticket responses.

* Use automation (e.g., chatbots or email triggers) to follow up if no agent response within X hours.

* Prioritize unresolved ticket flags in the helpdesk dashboard.


### Key Findings from Topic Modeling (NMF)

Using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) on TF-IDF features, support tickets were grouped into five dominant topics:


| Issue Category             | Description                                      | Suggested Improvement                      |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Account Access Issues     | Users face login failures                        | Add a password reset self-service feature  |
| Performance Problems      | App slow or crashes frequently                   | Optimize backend queries                   |
| Unresolved Support        | Tickets closed without actual resolution         | Improve agent follow-up workflows          |
| Data Privacy Concerns     | Users confused about data usage   



### üìå **Conclusion**

This analysis has provided meaningful insights into the core pain points customers are facing. By focusing improvements around login access, performance, and responsiveness, the support team can dramatically improve customer experience and reduce ticket volume over time.
